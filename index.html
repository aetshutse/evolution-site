          <h3>Bipedalism</h3>
          <p>Humans are unique in their ability to walk upright on two legs, which gave them advantages in seeing predators and carrying objects. The unique feature is an anterior foramen magnum. Humans are full time bipedals compared to other hominins or apes</p>

            <h3>Cognition</h3>
            <p>Human Intelligence stands out. Humans have a greater cognition compared to other apes. They can reason well. This is due to increased brain size relative to their body size over time.</p>

            <h3>Advanced tool use and technology</h3>
            <p>While some animals are also known to use tools, humans have been observed to make sophisticated tools and technology</p>

          <h3>Bipedalism</h3>
          <p>Hominins before humans were also known to have facultative or habitual bipedalism. With modern humans, bipedalism is the everyday locomotion they use and it is so much more effective. One of the morphological characteristics of the evolution to bipedalism is an S-shaped spine found in humans compared to the c-shaped spine of chimpz</p>
